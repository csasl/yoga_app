## A sequence builder and tracker for yoga poses

**Description of Project**  

The primary purpose of the app will be to enable users to browse yoga sequences, view the pose description and add it 
to a list of poses to create a personalized yoga sequence. The poses will be categorized by stage of workout: breathing, 
warm-up, main and warm-down and will be given a difficulty ranking. The target audience for the application is people 
who currently practice or are interested in starting a yoga practice. This project is of particular interest to me 
because I practice yoga regularly and know that it can be intimidating to start of with and may be difficult to make 
time to practice. This application would enable users to customize their routine based on the amount of time they have 
available and by level of difficulty.
