#Home Yoga
A sequence builder and tracker for yoga and pilates poses
Description of Project

The primary purpose of the app will be to enable users to browse yoga and pilates poses, view the pose description and add it to a list of poses to create a personalized yoga sequence. The poses will be categorized by stage of workout: breathing, warm-up, main and warm-down and will be given a difficulty ranking. The target audience for the application is people who currently practice or are interested in starting a yoga or pilates practice. This project is of particular interest to me because I practice yoga regularly and know that it can be intimidating to start of with and may be difficult to make time to practice. This application would enable users to customize their routine based on the amount of time they have available and by level of difficulty.
